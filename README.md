# gg2WayMosaic
An R function to provide a simple 2-way mosaic plot (ggplot) of categorical data. 

This is my first ever attempt to give something back to the FOSS community and the R community in particular.

This is a relatively simple function which takes a data frame of the columns (factors) and generates a 2-way mosaic plot.

The function is based on ggplot2.

I hope this finds use somewhere out there ... and if it does, feel free to contact me here at github or via mail: soren oneill dk
